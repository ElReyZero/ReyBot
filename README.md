# Rey Bot
This is a small project that I have been working on. 
It's a Discord bot with some of the commands I've implemented in the BWAE Services bot.

### Commands

- `/server_panel` Return the currrent status of a server of your choice. Default: Emerald
- `/census_health` Return the current status of the Census API
- `/send_timezone` Send a timezone for an event given a time, date and event name

Work In Progress!
